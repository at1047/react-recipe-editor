# React Recipe Creator

A simple react application that allows me to POST recipes to my MongoDB Recipe Collection. The UI allows users to add or remove ingredients, and manipulate all sorts of parameters that the Recipe collection requires. It also allows the user to preview the payload in a JSON format.
